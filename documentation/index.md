# Welcome to SJSU-Dev2's Documentation!

Cross platform firmware/software platform written by students, alumni, and
faculty of San Jose State University. Designed for the original purpose of
helping students develop firmware for the SJTwo board.

SJSU-Dev2 is an easy to use modern and modular C++ firmware development
platform. With the aim of making develop fast and allowing developers to develop
cross platform applications that work on various devices such as the LPC series
of microcontrollers, atmega, RISC-V, and single board linux computer such as
Raspberry Pi and Beagle Bone black.

!!! Warning
    SJSU-Dev2 is still in its beta stages and is still growing as a project. We
    have yet to onboard an ARM micrcontroller that wasn't apart of the LPC line,
    nor have we onboarded a linux single board computer. These are expected to
    be introduced to the platform by the end of 2020.
