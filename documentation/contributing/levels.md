# Common Guidelines across Levels

## Heirachy of inclusion

![Inclusion Heirachy](img/inclusion-heirachy.png)

### Explanation

Arrows indicate which levels can include from.
For example, `L2_HAL` can include `L1_Peripherals`, and
`L3_Application` can include `L2_HAL`.
`L3_Applications` should refrain from including `L1_Peripherals`.
If an `L3_Application` needs to include from `L1_Peripherals`, it
must only take the peripheral interface and not a specific platforms driver.
`L0_Platform` can include everything, except testing libraries, as its
startup may need code from any of the levels. In order to hit the
**light weight** goal, keep the code in startup to an absolute minimum.

Everything can include from `utility/` and `third_party/`. Although,
some third party libraries should not be included in some library code
levels. For example, microrl, used for command line control, should not
be included in anything in L1_Peripherals or even `L2_HAL`. There may be
consideration in the future to seperate the third party libraries into
their own set of levels that match the library levels.

This approach is meant to keep a levels of isolation between the
categories of files. Doing this can keep from circular dependencies and
unreasonable coupling between the layers.

Utilities are meant to be usable on all levels.
